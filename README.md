# Flexboxgrid Adobe XD

Original project from: https://github.com/kristoferjoseph/flexboxgrid

I adjusted the code to optimize the workflow with Adobe XD.

## Adjustments
- breakpoints Adobe XD/Flexboxgrid
- container paddings according to Adobe XD

## Mobile Breakpoints
- xs: Mobile
- sm: iPad, 768px
- md: Web, 1280px
- lg: Web, 1920px

- Use xs for mobile
- Use sm for iPad - 768px
- Skip 1024px (iPad Pro Mode)
- Use md for Web - 1280px
- Use lg for Web - 1920px

Feel free to use it.
